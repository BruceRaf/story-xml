The trick is finding me online; I'm in many places, but I don't hold
still for long.  If you really want to chat with me, your best bet is
to send me an email, and setup a day, time, and online-place to meet
(I've listed the places in my order of preference).<p>

EMail is always welcome.  If you want to be added to my distribution
list for story updates, just drop me a quick note, and I'll add your
address.  (See <a href="#privacy">My Privacy Policy</a> below.)<p>

OK, this isn't really a contact method, but it sure would get my
attention!  <img src="image/smile.gif" alt="smile"><p>

If you like my stories, maybe you would consider making a donation?
(Perhaps $5) Think of it as a being equivalent to "shareware"; you get
to read it all and pay for what you think it is worth.  As a small
reward, you'll see where the 618033989 number comes from.<p>

You might be interested to know that PayPal does not reveal any
account information about you to me.  PayPal acts as a third party to
manage the money transfers.  Only your e-mail and name you give to
PayPal is sent to me.  Also your address isn't required, because I'm
not shipping anything. So it is more secure than if you were to send a
check.<p>

I will not sell or intentionally reveal your e-mail or any personal

I will not post or forward your private messages or communication,
without your permission.<p>

However if you CC other addresses in messages to me, then I may reply
to all the addresses.<p>
