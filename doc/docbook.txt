-----------------------

Common Attributes

The following attributes occur on all elements. They are summarized here once for brevity and to make the additional attributes that occur on many elements stand out.

Name
	Type	Default
Arch	CDATA	None
Condition	CDATA	None
Conformance	NMTOKENS	None
ID	ID	

None/Required[a]
Lang	CDATA	None
OS	CDATA	None
Remap	CDATA	None
Role	CDATA	None
Revision	CDATA	None
RevisionFlag	
	Enumeration:
	Changed
	Added
	Deleted
	Off
	None
Security	CDATA	None
UserLevel	CDATA	None
Vendor	CDATA	None
XrefLabel	CDATA	None

[a] On a few elements, the ID is required, but on most it is not.

Arch

    Arch designates the computer or chip architecture to which the element applies.
Condition

    [4.0] Condition is a general-purpose effectivity attribute with no specified semantics. Many DocBook users observed that in order to add an effectivity condition that was unique to their environment required \x{201C}abusing\x{201D} the semantics of one of the existing attributes, or adding their own, making their customization an extension rather than a subset.

    The Condition attribute provides a standard place for application-specific effectivity.
Conformance

    Conformance indicates standards conformance characteristics of the item contained in the element. These characteristics are application-specific. DocBook provides no defaults.
ID

    ID is an identifying string for the element. It must be unique at least within the document and must begin with a letter.
Lang

    Lang should be a language code drawn from ISO 639 (perhaps extended with a country code drawn from ISO 3166, as en-US). Use it when you need to signal your application to change hyphenation and other display characteristics.
OS

    OS indicates the operating system to which the element is applicable. 
Remap

    Remap contains an element name or similar semantic identifier assigned to the content in a previous markup scheme.
Role

    Role contains a string used to classify or subclassify an element.

    While Role is a common attribute in the sense that it occurs on almost all elements, it is not part of either of the common attributes parameter entities (%common.attrib; or %idreq.common.attrib;). It is parameterized differently because it is useful to be able to subclass Role independently on different elements.
Revision

    Revision indicates the editorial revision to which the element belongs. 
RevisionFlag

    RevisionFlag indicates the revision status of element; the default is that the element hasn't been revised. RevisionFlag is intended only for simple revision management: to track the entire history of a document use a proper revision control system. Use RevisionFlag for indicating changes from one version to the next, no more.
Security

    [4.0] Security identifies something about the security level associated with the element to which it applies. 
UserLevel

    UserLevel indicates the level of user experience to which element applies. 
Vendor

    Vendor indicates the computer vendor to which the element applies.
XrefLabel

    XrefLabel holds text to be used when a cross reference (XRef) is made to the element.


Attribute Types

SGML offers a small selection of attribute types. (XML offers a subset of these.) For convenience, a brief description of each of these types is provided here:

CDATA

    A string of characters.
NUMBER

    A number. Numbers must begin with a hyphen or digit and can include the decimal point.
NMTOKEN

    A sequence of name characters (letters, digits, hyphens, and periods). This differs from a CDATA attribute because it cannot contain spaces, punctuation, or other non-name characters.
NMTOKENS

    A sequence of one or more space-delimited NMTOKEN values.
NUTOKEN

    A sequence of number characters (digits, hyphens, and periods). This differs from a NUMBER field because it is not required to begin with a digit or a hyphen.
ENTITY

    An entity name. The value of an ENTITY attribute must be the name of a declared entity.
NAME

    A name. A name must begin with a letter and can consist of letters, digits, hyphens, and periods.
NAMES

    A sequence of one or more space-delimited NAME values.
ID

    An ID. IDs are names that must be globally unique within the document. The ID attribute declares the ID.
IDREF

    An single ID. IDs are names that must be globally unique within the document. The value of an IDREF attribute must be the name of an ID attribute defined in the document.
IDREFS

    A sequence of one or more space-delimited ID values.

Attributes

fpi

    FPI holds the Formal Public Identifier for the Book. 
label

    Label specifies an identifying string for presentation purposes. The third Book in a Set might be labeled \x{201C}Volume III\x{201D}, for example.

    Generally, an explicit Label attribute is used only if the processing system is incapable of generating the label automatically. If present, the Label is normative; it will used even if the processing system is capable of automatic labelling. 
status

    Status identifies the editorial or publication status of the Book.

    Publication status might be used to control formatting (for example, printing a \x{201C}draft\x{201D} watermark on drafts) or processing (perhaps a document with a status of \x{201C}final\x{201D} should not include any components that are not final).
