vHi,

I'm just starting with Lulu.  I'm currenly using Linux tools
with FOP generating the PDF, from my custom XML, with the
Serna editor.

I've gone through the help sections, and can't find the
answers to these questions.

1) When submitting a PDF file, embedded font are required.
   This makes sense for the non-standard Adobe fonts.

   * What if I only use the standard Adobe fonts, will that
     be accepted?

2) For Global Distribution, the help text says the copyright
   page must include the ISBN number, but later it says that
   the ISBN number is assigned after the PDF is published.

   * So how is the ISBN number put in the copyright page?

3) For Global Distribution, the help text says that only
   Adobe Distiller generated PDF files are accepted.  Have
   you seen how expensive that tool is?!!  Hardly compatible
   with a free service like Lulu.

   * The CreatePDF subscription service looks more
     affordable, but will that fulfill the Adobe Distiller
     requirement?

   * More importantly, can I import my PDF, and have it
     converted into the accepted output?

If I can get this tool set to be compatable with Lulu's
publishing requirments, I would like to share my authoring
tools in the community area, with a link to a SourceForge
project.  The tool helps fiction writers manage, in one
structured document: plot threads, timelines, setting,
characters, viewpoint, scene and sequel outlines, and the
actual copy text.

Best regards,

Bruce Rafnel

Answers from forums and FOP mail list:

Adobe PDFs ONLY.
FOP can't generate an Adobe PDF directly.

Route to LUL
FOP -> ps
upload ps, to have it convert to PDF

Can't do full-bleed, becuase FOP doesn't embed fonts into ps files.
If it did, an Adobe program can be used to convert the ps to PDF (but
this is still tricky and windows only).
