<li><p>The current date routines limit the dates to the years:
1970 -2037</p>

<li><p>The current date routines assume earth time, so they
will no work for SF stories set on planets with different
day/month/year cycles.<p>
</li>

<p>If set in space, and earth seconds are used as a
constant, then a 25 hour day would be a rational division
for days, which would be exactly 90,000 sec long.  Weeks
could be 10 days long, grouped into 4 week months, then 10
month years, which works out to 1000 hours/year.</p>

<pre>
24 * 365 = 8760 hours/year
25 * 50 * 10 = 12500 hours/year

1000 hours/year / 25 days = 400
400 / 10 months = 40 days/month
40 days/month / 10 days/week = 4 weeks
