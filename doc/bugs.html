  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The current date routines limit the dates to the years: 1970 -
      2037</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The current date routines assume earth time, so they will not
      work for SF stories set on planets with different day/month/year
      cycles.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>

    <li style="list-style: none">
      <p>If set in space, and earth seconds are used as a constant, then a
      25 hour day could be a rational length for days, which would be
      exactly 90,000 sec long. Weeks could be 10 days long, grouped into 4
      week months, then 10 month years, which works out to 10,000
      hours/year.</p>
      <pre>
24 * 365 = 8760 hours/year
25 * 50 * 10 = 12500 hours/year

10,000 hours/year / 25 days = 400
400 / 10 months = 40 days/month
40 days/month / 10 days/week = 4 weeks
